# Hangman

This repository contains a Java implementation of the game HANGMAN consisting of words from the MARVEL Universe. 
The list will be updated at a later point in time.

>You can choose between three levels: 

**(1) easy:**

You've got 15 attempts to guess the word. The letters that were not guessed right, will appear in the terminal.

**(2) medium:**

You've got 7 attempts to guess the word. The letters that were not guessed right, will appear in the terminal.

**(2) hard:**

You've got 10 attempts to guess the word. The letters that were not guessed right, will appear in the terminal. If you try the same incorrect letters again, you will get punished by having one less attempt.
